fellaini becomes the second united player booked as he commits himself to a late challenge on henderson
a wonderful delivery there from milner as united again struggle to convincingly clear their lines
a second change from van gaal here sees memphis depay replace herrera
stat juan mata has scored three goals and assisted four more in his last six premier league appearances against liverpool
incredibly quick reactions on display as he dives well across to his right and shows his strong wrists as he does just enough to keep out can 's bullet from range after a very poor clearance attempt from darmian
van gaal makes the first move and it 's a necessary switch from the dutchman who brings on juan mata with lingard giving way
smalling is beaten for pace by firmino and is forced into a cynical tug of the brazilian 's shirt which sees him into the referee 's book
united could use a creative central figure with herrera offering no inventiveness at the moment

borthwick-jackson sends an inviting ball into the area from the left but rooney flubs at it

lucas picks out lallana atop the area and he plays a one two with henderson before rolling a pass through for firmino
it 's absolutely the right decision from clattenburg as firmino goes to ground rather theatrically inside the area under the slightest contact from blind who is none too pleased with the brazilian 's attempt to win a cheap spot kick
can is dispossessed in midfield and the ball is sent forward to rooney but the striker is blocked off by lucas who sends the ball back the other way
sakho gives the ball away carelessly exactly what united have been waiting for
with the exception of the lallana chance this match has been sorely lacking in quality thus far
lucas ' inclusion in the starting lineup has been justified through the opening 20 minutes as he remains responsible in possession but most importantly has helped disrupt united 's rhythm on the ball
fellaini gets perhaps a bit over-aggressive with milner and lucas right up against the touchline directly in front of the liverpool fans
milner is played in along the right and he sends a half-volley at goal but fails to hit the target
lucas sends a delightful ball over the top for lallana to chase
they let the likes of toure and sakho spend as much time as they want on the ball and so far it has worked to the visitors ' benefit as they 've been able to pack bodies in midfield to negate the impact of can and henderson
martial presents the first test with some determined direct running on the ball forcing jordan henderson into a foul

sergio aguero opened the scoring with his 100th premier league goal though it should n't have counted undoing a positive start from newcastle
cynical from anita who realises he 's not going to be able to keep up with kolarov as the left-back looked to break so he steps in front of his counter-part to break up the move
sissoko nabs the assist though that was all in the individual skill of anita
anita sprints down the right and cuts into the area past some dreadful marking from kolarov before sending a finish crashing off the far post and in
it 's horrible defending from kompany who despite being the last defender commits himself to a tackle at the halfway line
city put the ball out of play with yaya toure down and injured
lascelles completely loses his concentration and gifts the ball to de bruyne who goes in with aguero two-against-one
stat that was the 100th goal sergio aguero scored in the premier league in 147 appearances making him the 2nd quickest to 100 goals in the competition after alan shearer ( 124 apps )

city have drastically changed their formation as they play with three centre-halves now in otamendi mangala and demichelis which has pushed the likes of zabaleta and kolarov forward

stat virgil van dijk has won 74 % of his 206 aerial duels in the premier league this season the highest ratio of any player to have been involved in 100+ aerials
city make their first change of the evening and it 's a surprising one as martin demichelis replaces fernandinho
southampton make a swap of their own as clasie is replaced by oriol romeu
fonte is credited with the assist though he knew little about it
davis ' wonderful corner is met by van dijk who sends a thumping header off the bar
tadic is late reacting to try and track the run of zabaleta on the overlap as he 's forced to tug back on the shirt of the right-back which prompts referee andre marriner to go to his pocket and pull out a yellow card
despite southampton 's positive start it 's city who carve out the first chance through who other than iheanacho
zabaleta and kolarov 's lack of pace have proven detrimental to the visitors at the back as they struggle to deal with the width saints have on display
goals from shane long and sadio mane provided southampton a deserved 2-0 lead inside of 30 minutes as they came out of the gate with a bit between their teeth

mane and clasie combine to win the ball in the attacking half with delph giving possession away cheaply
city are having little success trying to play their way into attack on the ground while southampton are starting to resort to long-balls over the top in the hopes of picking out the run of long who is rather isolated up top
ryan bertand makes quick work of zabaleta on the flank but his cross ca n't pick out a team-mate
it was from this position and around this time that ozil clipped in the winner fo welbeck against leicester but it 's not to be as fabianski punches clear
welbeck attacks a cross from walcott but the latter angled it in with his weaker left foot and without any power leaving the former with too much to do and he ca n't convert

campbell started this game with a bang and did his job by opening the scoring but he 's not quite maintained that level
naughton 's cross on the overlap fails to find a team-mate but the visitors keep the play alive and work it to gomis on the opposite side but the big striker fails to muster up another shooting chance
alexis is on the end of an arsenal chance again or at least he was trying to be on this occasion
ozil whips a corner into the area and alexis takes it onto his chest before prodding the ball for the bottom corner but williams deflects it wide

campbell and bellerin link up but in a recurring theme the full-back 's cross does n't find a team-mate
ki has been replaced by sigurdsson in the only half-tme change from either team
the gunners have dominated this match in terms of possession and chances but could not add to campbell 's fine opener with routledge drawing the welsh side level shortly after the half-hour mark
routledge ca n't catch up to ki 's through pass before it crosses the byline and that may be that
mertesacker does well to cushion a header into the path of the frenchman who attacks it with a ferocious right-footed volley from 12 yards out but crashes it against the crossbar
ayew bundles over monreal and we have the first booking of the game
poor from bellerin again
nice idea for ozil to try to thread in alexis with a diagonal ball goal-side of the full-back but the execution is n't quite up to his intention
bellerin's crossing has left a lot to be desired in this game
great awareness from cork to spot the gap between two defenders and find his man
arsenal denied a free-kick in the middle of the park but swansea play on and routledge latches onto a through ball between mertesacker and bellerin to slot in a clever finish
a lovely touch on a long pass from alexis by campbell sees the forward set up for a volley from about 25 yards but the defence reads it and blocks his attempt

another sweeping arsenal move sees a high ball head towards ozil at the top of the box
apart from an early little scamper from gomis there 's not been much of an offensive threat from swansea

fabregas leaves flamini for dead and drifts into the box meaning that koscielny has to run across to cover
one delivery finds the head of matic inside the box but his flick is blocked by his teammate zouma
a hat-trick of offsides for walcott now after ozil did excellently to shrug off a challenge from his marker before pinging a languid ball over the top for the forward to chase
costa is caught offside either side of a bizarre sequence where ozil advanced to the top of the box and had space to shoot but held the ball waiting for a run which never arrived
no changes to round up from the half-time break but it 's chelsea with the first chance of the second half as oscar 's shot takes a deflection on its way off target after a decent attack
costa was denied a clear goalscoring opportunity by mertesacker 's poor challenge which saw the gemran dismissed
the blues appear to have shut the door on the edge of the box but ramsey finds an excellent lofted ball into flamini - unmarked about 10 yards out
flamini bodies willian off the ball conceding a free-kick about 35 yards out and getting a yellow card for his troubles
from the resulting corner monreal heads the ball off the line ahead of cech and arsenal are on the break
arsenal launch a clever counterattack with ramsey wriggling between a pair of players to poke in walcott down the left again but once more the forward is just off
the next ball from monreal is infinitely better as he slides one between two defenders for walcott on the right but the england international slides his finish the wrong side of the post with the flag up for offside anyway
a good arsenal move on the left has monreal in all kinds of space for a cross but all the arsenal players in the box stand off instead of making a run and the spaniard whacks his delivery right into the legs of ivanovic
the ball pops off ramsey 's instep into the chest of willian and the arsenal fans hopefully appeal for a handball
fabregas is running the show on his former stomping grounds
a different angle of the mertesacker sending off shows the german defender having a glance across the line just before sliding in for a challenge - either to check for an offside flag or the position of his partner koscielny
it was a soft strike to concede and there 's no way to blame that on chelsea 's man advantage as both koscielny and gabriel were positioned at the near post and should have dealt with it
great cross from ivanovic who split both centre-backs with that ball for costa to finish
he makes a critical run between gabriel and koscielny to the near post to attack ivanovic 's cross and beat cech with a clever first-time finish

campbell is sent flying by oscar on the right-hand side
excellent move from arsenal as giroud skips past his man and lays it off to campbell
ramsey wins the ball back in an accomplished manner and strides from his own half to the edge of the opposition box
still it 's the gunners on the back foot at the moment with fabregas pulling the strings - to the displeasure of the fans
fabregas shows great close control to sneak towards the byline and he gets a cutback into the box but the defence clears the danger before the prowling costa can pounce centrally
action in both ends of the field early on as walcott tries to emulate his assist for campbell against sunderland with a clipped cross from the left byline which the costa rican attacks with a side-foot volley but he does n't connect properly
we ’ re into the first of three minutes added time at the end of this game now as gradel looks to carve out another opportunity for himself down the left but this time the danger is sniffed out by paredes
what a chance for bournemouth as gradel twists and turns in the area before drilling an effort goalwards but gomes displays all of his athleticism to tip the strike on to the roof of the net
well after going so long without reaching for his cards the referee seems to be going wild now as he books cathcart for a foul on gradel - with the wales defender having tugged on the shirt of the diminutive ivory coast winger

that is brilliant once more from hibbert who despite being put into trouble by cleverley ’ s sloppy pass makes a fantastic recovering challenge to prevent afobe powering into everton ’ s territory
fantastic defending from hibbert who expertly tracks the run of stanislas and matches the pace of the bournemouth winger before making a terrific sliding challenge to prevent the resulting strike on goal troubling howard
that brilliant run will be the final action of the game for callum wilson as he is taken off in place of lewis grabban who is yet to open his goalscoring account since returning to bournemouth from norwich city back in january
that ’ s an awful attempt from afobe who latched onto a brilliant cross from wilson after the bournemouth no13 had made his way into the penalty area with a superb driving run
that ’ s superb play from stones who races out of the everton defence and carries the ball all the way to the opposite byline before coolly slipping a pass back into lennon
the tempo of this match has certainly been upped since everton re-established their lead and in turn the visitors made the double substitution with afobe offering a real outlet for bournemouth to be a bit more direct in their attacking play
that was a vital block by pennington who gets across to prevent afobe powering in a leveller after the everton defence were caught napping
that change is quickly followed up by another substitution by howe as benik afobe - who has scored four goals since his arrival from wolves in january - replaces josh king
a first change of the game now for the visitors as their goalscorer marc pugh makes way for junior stanislas
barkley played in hibbert with a lovely pass and the full-back unusually high up the pitch gets in a cross-cum-shot that fortunately for bournemouth is gathered in by boruc
that ’ s a fantastic finish by baines who marks the 500th appearance of his career with a superbly taken strike
much like king ’ s assist in the first half for pugh ’ s strike cleverley ’ s pass was little more than a miss-kick but that will matter little to everton as baines was on hand to tuck home the chance with his first goal from open play since january 2013
that ’ s a tame effort from ritchie
a free-kick in a really dangerous position now for the visitors as ritchie who stands over the set-piece was felled by gibson 20 yards out
the break in play as a result of that effort sees romelu lukaku thrown into the frey
that ’ s rather wasteful from wilson who after turning and twisting away from his marker elects to drive an effort towards the near post that slams into the side-netting though it seems he would have been better off playing it across to his strike partner who was waiting unmarked in the six-yard box
that ’ s dreadful defending once more from everton as king is provided with acres of space on the cusp of the penalty area
that ’ s good play from niasse who rises well to challenge with cook and nudge a header back into the path of barkley
that ’ s wasteful from pugh who after he initially did well to drive down the left plays a sloppy and overhit pass out towards ritchie who is unable to stretch to reach it
it is another dreadful set-piece delivery from the hosts and the visitors are able to easily clear the ball out as far as hibbert on the halfway line
a pause in play now as cook who took a knock from barkley when he slid in to prevent the midfielder driving through on goal receives some extensive treatment for what looks to be an injury to his upper body
the hosts do finally step it up as mccarthy slips an inviting pass into the path of barkley but the midfielder ’ s touch is a poor one and cook gets over to make a superb covering tackle
everton get lucky there as king latches onto a cross to meet it on the half-volley but the former blackburn rovers strike can only skew his effort well wide of the target
there will be one change at half time as martinez introduces tony hibbert in place of muhamed besic
the game started off in a flurry of activity as just two minutes after falling behind to tom cleverley ’ s strike the visitors were level courtesy of mark pugh ’ s ninth-minute effort
that ’ s unlucky from niasse who manages to latch onto a poor corner from baines and direct a header in the general direction of the target
another heart-in-the-mouth moment for pennington as he makes a poor decision down on the left and is swiftly smothered by wilson
that ’ s a smart bit of goalkeeping by boruc who came off his line swiftly to prevent barkley sliding a finish into the back of the net after he had raced onto the end of niasse ’ s perfectly weighted through ball
that ’ s good link-up play between niasse and barkley as the former lokomotiv moscow forward finds the england midfielder with a neat pass
the movement is poor with barkley mccarthy and niasse all standing stock still and after a period of 10-plus passes that went nowhere it eventually falls to baines who has no other option than to punt a hopeful pass upfield
despite the mistake for bournemouth ’ s equaliser pennington has had a solid start to his premier league debut especially considering that he is playing alongside fellow 21-year-old albeit a vastly more experienced one in the form of john stones
that ’ s a good effort from ritchie as the scotland winger – renowned for his ability to find the net with strikes from distance – tries his luck with a first-time left-footed shot 25 yards out from goal
there was an opportunity there for gibson to sweep a simple pass out to besic who had picked up a great advanced position down the right wing
that ’ s a ridiculous back pass from besic as the bosnia and herzegovina midfielder cuts out a deep cross by francis but instead of hooking it away from danger plays a cushioned pass back into the path of howard who has to react swiftly in order to make the clearance
an opportunity to counter now for everton as gibson regains possession with a robust challenge and immediately looks to set barkley free
a slight lull in proceedings now following that whirlwind start as everton work the ball from right to left with gibson spreading the play with a superb diagonal ball over to baines
the everton players aren ’ t happy that bournemouth ’ s goal was allowed to stand as they feel pennington was fouled by wilson in the build-up
king ’ s assist was nothing more than a miss-kick but given the shambolic nature of everton ’ s defending it was all that was needed
that goal really sums up the hosts ’ entire campaign as less than two minutes after they take the lead pennington is shirked off the ball by wilson who slides a cross into the area
he was found by barkley following a neat bit of play down the left flank and after taking a tidy first touch to set himself drilled a low left-footed finish past boruc and into the bottom corner
it was a tidy bit of build-up play from the hosts as barkley who has not assisted or scored in his last 10 appearances capped off the move with a precise ball into the feet of cleverley
that ’ s a fine tackle by besic who slides in on pugh to prevent the winger driving into the everton penalty area
a promising moment now for pennington as the youngster does well to drive out from the back and slip a neat pass into baines down the left
a booking now for ross barkley who fouled alex song
yellow card diafra sakho
it was nothing more than a hopeful punt into the area from diafra sakho who won the initial knock-down and payet duly applied the finish

a final change now for everton as gareth barry - who missed out on a starting berth due to a chest infection - replaces romelu lukaku as the hosts look to see this game out
everton are really pressing here but west ham are looking deadly on the counter as noble picks out payet
that ’ s top defending from cresswell who gets across to beat coleman to a superb cross into the area from oviedo
barkley does brilliantly to drive away from danger and lay off a great pass into the path of lukaku but the belgium forward ’ s heavy first touch is a costly one and the move breaks down
huge appeals for a penalty once more by everton as besic ’ s strike hits ogbonna in the area but once more the referee waves away the claims
dimitri payet 's have been unusually poor today but he put in a superb cross when it counted that sakho duly got on the end of
well everton have defended excellently so far this afternoon but they have been exposed here as payet delivers another pinpoint cross that sakho heads home into the bottom-left corner
a booking now for angelo ogbonna after he cynically pulls back lukaku
it was a great cross by mark noble who put it on a plate for antonio
a lifeline for west ham then as noble drifts in a dangerous ball that is headed home powerfully by antonio
claims for handball from payet whose volley strikes the arm of besic but there is nothing doing for the referee
a change now for everton as oumar niasse is introduced in place of aaron lennon who has been super this afternoon
a booking now for joel robles who picks up a yellow card for descent
west ham win another corner down on the right which payet again lifts into the area
lukaku should have scored
penalty miss romelu menama lukaku

smart defending from funes-mori as he gets across on the cover to ensure that sakho is unable to get on the end of a throughball from deep

a chance for west ham as they lump a cross into the area towards the head of carroll
the second substitution sees pedro obiang make way for alexandre song who made his premier league debut - for arsenal - against the toffees
and those changes will now take place the first of which sees emmanuel emenike replaced by diafra sakho
it was another superb move from the hosts as lennon and lukaku combined with perfection to carve open west ham 's defence
lennon who has been given a free role in the second half jinks inside and links up expertly with lukaku getting on the end of the belgian ’ s return pass before coolly slotting home
coleman gets down the right at pace and drinks a cross towards barkley on the edge of the area
a patient move from west ham as they work it down the right with noble skipping past barkley before laying it off to antonio
good pressure from everton high up the pitch as besic gets on the ball and pulls the strings in west ham ’ s half
payet drops in a superb cross from the resulting set-piece which is met on the rise by antonio but the former nottingham forest winger - who scored with a header against tottenham last time out - can only direct his effort off target
top defending from jagielka who does excellently to prevent another brilliant delivery from cresswell finding emenike in the six-yard box
it ’ s been a positive start to the second half by the hosts as lukaku manages to get on the ball and turn towards goal bursting forward at pace from midfield
and for everton muhamed besic - who has missed seven games through injury - replaces john stones which will add some steal and grit to everton ’ s diminished midfield
for west ham andy carroll replaces reece oxford
first john stones was clearly fouled by reece oxford at an everton corner before at the other end ramiro funes-mori appeared to have tugged back angelo ogbonna as the west ham defender attempted to get on the end of a payet cross
mirallas ’ second booking was a definite yellow though cresswell did definitely not help his opponent ’ s case by staying down for longer than seemed necessary
payet has become somewhat of a set-piece specialist for west ham this term but that one was certainly not one of his best as his strike sails way over the crossbar
that ’ s a silly tackle by jagielka who gives west ham the perfect opportunity to level as he concedes a free-kick right on the edge of the area
everton have returned to a more familiar back four since they went down to ten men with lennon coming across to the left side of midfield and coleman pushing up to the right wing
cresswell drills in another terrific cross that emenike gets on the end of on this occasion with a first-time flick towards goal but robles somehow reacts to prevent the ball going over the line
emineke drops in a cross that robles collects before being clattered into by antonio
the temperature is really beginning to rise now at goodison and you have to say it is all down to that decision by the referee to send mirallas off
mirallas is sent off
mirallas eventually does well to regain possession down on the left linking around lanzini and forcing the visitors ’ midfielder into conceding a throw-in
payet delivered a precise corner to the back post which caught funes-mori out
great play from west ham as cresswell combines with lanzini down the left and the argentine is duly fouled deep in everton ’ s territory by coleman
good strong and committed defending from mirallas as he slides in on antonio
that ’ s another fantastic stop from adrian who reacts brilliantly to prevent barkley ’ s rasping strike going in at the near post
finally the hosts get it cleared quickly and mirallas latches onto the loose ball
it is worked out wide to cresswell who flashes a superb cross across the face of goal but emenike is unable to latch onto it for what would have been a tap-in
a sloppy pass from stones allows west ham to capitalise and maintain a short spell of pressure on everton ’ s goal
more appeals for a penalty now from the hosts as lennon ’ s cross appears to strike the arm of ogbonna
a free-kick now for west ham as mccarthy could emenike in a central position 30 yards from everton ’ s goal
a yellow card now for mirallas who went down under pressure from kouyate
it was a patient and incisive move by everton capped off by a great throughball by bryan oviedo with lukaku duly doing the rest
what a finish by lukaku
poor defending from everton invites payet to drive forward from midfield and power a low effort at goal
the visitors eventually manage to get their star man payet on the ball and the ex-marseille man jinks inside before attempting to pick out emenike with an ambitious throughball but robles is alert to the danger and comes out to collect the ball
appeals for a penalty now from everton as stones claims he had been tugged back by oxford in the area from the resulting set-piece and it does appear that he was

harry kane 's day also comes to an end a few minutes early as he 's replaced by josh onomah
all hands on deck for the swans as striker bafetimbi gomis comes on for the final seven minutes plus stoppage time replacing midfielder ki
ayew finds a pocket of space and manages to cut inside his marker but ca n't get enough power behind his shot to really test lloris
eriksen finds kane whose chipped-cross over the top picks out walker and the right-back turns it in - but he could n't stay onside
paloschi with a tremendous bit of skill at the far post to send a thumping half-volley at goal which the tottenham keeper somehow manages to parry
it 's been coming and danny rose is the unlikely scorer
swansea make their first change and it brings with it the debut of leroy fer
son 's last involvement nearly sees him set-up a second chadli goal but the belgian 's effort is wide
another outstanding save from fabianski this time to deny eriksen 's swerving and dipping strike from close to 40-yards out
walker picks up the assist for his clever delivery
a rare slip from fabianski who neglects to catch a corner allowing it to come to walker
that had to be close to 35-yards out from rose on the half-volley as he sends a remarkable effort at goal but fabianski turns it over the bar
williams throws himself in front of rose 's effort from range following a spurs corner and does enough to turn it wide of the far post
the hosts are having no problem getting the ball into the box and testing fabianski but they ca n't buy a goal
another effort from eriksen
pochettino makes the first change of the game bringing on nacer chadli in place of erik lamela
stat christian eriksen has had a hand in five goals ( three scored two assisted ) in his last five league games
from the same angle only a couple of yards closer eriksen goes for the opposite corner this time
ayew is booked for a cynical challenge atop the swansea penalty area and this ensuing free-kick should prove a real worry for the visitors
swansea need a bit more of that if only to give their defence and fabianski some deserved rest
rose slides recklessly into the back of ayew with an altogether untidy challenge and he becomes the first tottenham player booked on the afternoon
kane has a go from a long way out as pressure continues to build but fabianski takes no chances as he knocks the curling effort behind - although it did n't appear to be heading on target
it 's equally impressive from eriksen who whips a free-kick in with great pace but the swansea keeper dives across to his right to keep it off the line
collected well by fabianski
tottenham start quickly on the front foot with eriksen picking out a peach of a pass for rose
alberto paloschi 's first premier league goal has struggling swansea in front at the interval at white hart lane at the end of a wildly entertaining first half in london
fabianski with a world class stop equal to the one lloris produced early on as he reacts brilliantly to stick out a hand and deny dier from point-blank range
lamela picks out a poor pass for son which runs behind for a goal-kick and the south korea international is n't at all happy with the delivery as frustration starts to set in a bit from spurs ' point of view
paloschi finds his name on the gamesheet for a second time today this one for a very different reason however as he nearly rips the jersey right off the back of walker to halt the full-back 's run - and is promptly issued a yellow card
lloris ' scrambled clearance comes to ayew who plays rangel down the right
much needed breather for swansea as paloschi holds the ball up smartly and wins a free-kick in the attacking third
alli picks out a clever ball for son who takes it and turns beautifully
alli 's strong run sees the ball into the path of lamela inside the area but the argentine 's shot is kept out smartly by fabianski at the near post
it 's not the most difficult of saves in the end for fabianski who has eyes on eriksen 's free-kick the whole way and is able to dive across to the near post to usher it aside
eriksen and lamela stand over the ensuing free-kick but it winds up being the latter who takes and his effort is abysmal
ashley williams is shown the game 's first yellow card for an ill-timed slide to break up alli 's run
it has been all tottenham since falling behind but no test yet for fabianski
eriksen lifts the free-kick invitingly into the penalty area - as we 've come to expect from him - and it 's met by dier but the midfielder sends a header well over the bar
cork is penalised for a foul on dier from about 35-yards out but the replay shows he got all of the ball and none of the man
cork picks up the assist as it was his presence that deflected sigurdsson 's shot into the italian 's path

stoke 's creative players afellay bojan and arnautovic are n't really getting a sniff at the moment as the hammers press ahead for the opener
cresswell bursts down the left flank once again and finds a yard of space before whipping a wicked cross to the front post
great block by wollscheid
chances at either end have been few and far between but the best opportunity fell to marco van ginel who somehow manages to screw a strike wide from six yards out after some great work by afellay
shawcross has lost his head in the past couple of minutes or so as within that time he has gave the ball away which almost leaded to a conceded goal and stupidly came through the back of carroll on the edge of the box to concede a foul in a dangerous position
cresswell gets into an advanced position down the left wing and finds himself up againg johnson
first booking of the match now and it is a deserved one for erik pieters as he blatantly halts a west ham counterattack with a block on kouyate down the right wing
there 's a small break in play at the moment as carroll is down after a collision with shawcross off the ball
without the likes of payet and lanzini out there west ham could probably benefit from going slightly more direct in their attacking play as carroll typically struggles with the more trickier stuff
stoke have had a lot of joy down the right-hand side so far and this time it is johnson who drives forward from right-back to provide the width
arnautovic finally sees a bit of possession as he drops deep to the left wing before attempting to cut inside past kouyate
arnautovic has n't been involved in the game alot so far but he is always playing on the shoulder of the last defender looking to take advantage of the space in behind should it become available
as mentioned previously antonio has been decent so far on the right flank but his decision making has n't been too great when it comes to the final ball
apart from that glaring miss from van ginkel we have n't seen too much in terms of goalscoring chances in the respective boxes
they have did well at this so far today as west ham struggle to find an opening in and around the box which leads to carroll eventually surrendering possession
antonio has probably been west ham 's brightest player so far and seems eager to prove himself in a rare start which has only came around due to the injury to lanzini during the week
afellay continues to look the most likely player to create something leading to a goal here as he collects possession in the central area before twisting and turning on the edge of the area aiming to get a shot away
carroll displays some impressive strength up top to shake off the attentions of wollscheid and then brings the ball deep to slide a lovely pass out wide for noble who eventually finds song
afellay who has looked a real menace down that right wing so far gets into a useful position once again and reverses a pass back into the danger area
afellay breaks away down the right touchline and makes his way inside before teasing a wicked cross along the six-yard box for van ginkel who attempts to stick out a leg to stab into the empty net
mark hughes has spoke this week about how there is added pressure on his charges due to the impressive manner of their win over manchester city this week so it will be interesting to see if the same level of performance is prominen away from the britannia
as mentioned previously the hammers are suffering from an injury crisis at the moment but they still have players out there like zarate and carroll who can hurt the opposition
marko arnautovic does n't look too happy as he goes off to be replaced by charlie adam
diouf is proving to be a real handful for the spurs defence as he heads another chance straight at lloris

eriksen tries his luck from 30 yards but it flies wide
goal tottenham 2-0 stoke ( chadli ) chadli latches onto davies ' cross and volleys spurs further ahead

lloris does really well to save diouf 's close range header as stoke press for an equaliser before half-time
close for stoke as arnautovic plays a one two and lashes a shot just wide
kane has been quiet this afternoon despite that disallowed goal stoke are doing a good job on him
great counterattack as chadli races goalwards but stoke manage to scramble the ball away
harry kane has the ball in the back of the net but the offside flag is up
tottenham 's midfield have done well so far dier is looking impressive in his central position
walker went into the book for that foul
marko arnautovic wins a free-kick from walker
goal tottenham 1-0 stoke ( dier ) lovely movement from dier who loses his marker and heads home eriksen 's corner
mason 's powerful effort takes a deflection and goes out for a corner

eriksen dembele and mason are linking up well for the home side
the latest of time-wasting changes as walcott comes on for giroud
the arsenal defence froze as cook puts his foot through a loose ball inside the area which the keeper saves with his legs
the welshman is in the clear and has giroud in support
king tries to buy a spot-kick off monreal but the referee feels that he went down too easily
ramsey lashes a long ball through the middle for giroud to chase but he 's never going to get there ahead of boruc
stanislas has provided a reliable spark down the right since his introduction and another delivery puts king in a great position to score but he fails to make a meaningful connection on the ball
an off game once more for alexis who is still struggling to find his feet after that long injury layoff
so there 's no scoring statement made today by afobe against his former club as he 's pulled by howe
finally arsenal create the right move to launch a counter-attack as alexis races into space before squaring to ramsey on his left
decent chance there for the hosts as stanislas ' cross takes a nick off koscielny which cech grabs before afobe can figure out what 's going on
wenger follows suit with a change of his own introducing coquelin for the goalscorer oxlade-chamberlain in a clear defensive alteration intended to shore up his midfield
gosling departs after a mediocre game and is replaced by joshua king
that chance was indeed ritchie 's last comtribution of this game
ritchie has space and time to drive into the arsenal half but once in position at the top of the box he lashes an effort wildly into the stratosphere for the third time in this match
afobe has held the ball up well here and his quick feet have also enabled him to evade challenges from retreating arsenal players whenever his back has been to goal
alexis takes smith to the cleaners beating him to the byline before lashing the ball into the six-yard area
giroud loses out in a foot-race with smith and in his attempts to win the ball back steps on the heel of the player with his trailing leg
first chance of the second period for the gunners as from a corner giroud overpowers cook to get his head to the ball but it 's right down the throat of boruc
smith somehow keeps a hold of the ball when trying to turn koscielny and he lashes one on goal from inside the area but it 's the wrong side of the post
decent look here for ritchie who is the beneficiary of a feed from smith but not for the first time in this game he fails to keep his effort under the crossbar and the chance is gone
a pair of accomplished finishes from ozil and oxlade-chamberlain within a minute of each other burst this game into life
cech comes to arsenal 's rescue again as he positions himself at the near post to block a shot from smith who had escaped into the box behind a ball-watching monreal down the flank
arsenal try to launch a late attack but both oxlade-chamberlain and bellerin see the door shut down the right
good bit of hold-up play from giroud who plucks a pass from cech out of the sky and puts arsenal on the attack in the bournemouth half immediately
arsenal are closing this half on the defensive as their former player afobe gets a decent run into the area but the trajectory of his movement ultimately takes him too far away from goal
daniels marauds down the right channel and gets the ball into the feet of the lively arter
surman dictates a decent spell of possession for the hosts as he spins onto a pass from daniels before playing in smith deep down the right-hand side
giroud is penned in by smith near the corner flag but manages to buy a corner off his legs - which comes to nothing
the brazilian is caught in possession by pugh and suddenly the midfielder is through on goal
arter advances to the top of the box and lets fly with a stinger of an effort from range which needs the full flexibility of cech to tip over the crossbar
ramsey sprays a pass for the arriving oxlade-chamberlain down the left and he runs onto the ball wide of his man before driving a tremendous low finish across the keeper and in via the base of the far post
ramsey spotted the run of his team-mate and played the pass with perfect timing
a lovely little flick-on at the back post to set up that finish for ozil
since awarding that yellow card to flamini the referee has n't given a lot to the home side despite the feeling in the ground that a few arsenal challenges deserved to be penalised
after a bournemouth attack breaks downarsenal break quickly and a cross into the area from bellerin seems primed for giroud
a long ball over the top misses giroud but is picked up by alexis instead
afobe is shaping up to be a handful for the gunners and he wins a free-kick off monreal presenting bournemouth with a decent little chance
bournemouth are starting to take control of this game since that booking for flamini and the gunners are struggling to get the ball out of their own half
poor challenge from flamini who takes a chunk out of arter with a two-footed lunge
good period for the visitors as they carve their way quickly down the left and monreal's cutback is cleared only to ramsey at the top of the area
oxlade-chamberlain advances through the middle and slides a pass between the centre-backs for alexis to chase
a moment of indecision at the back for arsenal nearly lets afobe through meaning that cech has to race off his line to get to the ball first
into the first of three additional minutes and kolarov goes into the book for time wasting kicking the ball away following a free kick awarded to southampton
southampton put up a great fight in the second half cutting the deficit in half through long and coming close on a few occasions to equalising
horrible from bony
mane drives into the area and had both tadic and juanmi to his left but selfishly goes for goal himself
toure stands level with the ball as he lines up a free kick from 25-yards out after winning an argument with de bruyne over who should take it
the spanish striker with join long up top playing just in behind him with ward-prowse giving way
a roar of approval from the city fans as their magician david silva is introduced for the final 15 minutes making his long-awaited return from injury
kolarov 's goal has assuredly curbed any hopes of ascendency from the visitors
fernando has come on to offer some fresh legs in midfield for the hosts with delph giving way
the chip across from de bruyne in the buildup to not only spot kolarov but get the ball over to him was extraordinary
kolarov finds himself in acres of space at the near post taking a pass over the top and driving the absolutely perfect strike past stekelenburg and just inside the far post
what an impact tadic has made
they win the ball back just inside their own end and break with pace but toure 's strike at the other end is n't enough to trouble stekelenburg
heart into the stomach moment for city fans as aguero immediately pulls up lame following an awkward landing at the far post
city are in sixes-and-sevens in defence as no one wants to take responsibility and put in a challenge allowing tadic to walk clean through into the area
he 's been thrown into the gauntlet caulker with the injury to fonte but has performed admirably
long takes a pass and flicks it beyong demichelis who simply tosses the irishman to ground
ward-prowse commits a good team foul as he recognises the danger with yoshida beaten before sliding in to chop sterling to ground
everyone is breaking forward now for the saints as opposed to the first half when mane and long were largely stranded on an island
it 's how the free kick was awarded that has evoked controversy however as roger east brings play all the way back to where ward-prowse was taken out by kolarov but he had allowed the play to go on for close to seven or eight seconds before making the decision
that goal was all made possible by the cross however as mane floated it in wonderfully from the right
it was a fantastic jump from long at the far post who despite being smaller in stature rises above demichelis to head home mane 's cross
delph just fails to sort his footing atop the six-yard box after taking a pass from sterling out wide who again had the beating of yoshida
with goals the priority for southampton in the second half ronald koeman has opted to bring on winger dusan tadic for holding midfielder oriol romeu
the sky blues came flying out of the gate but the saints are the architects of their own downfall with sloppy play in their own end leading to goals for kevin de bruyne and fabian delph inside 20 minutes
he sprints forward and into the area with pace but the final touch is just a bit heavy as it runs to stekelenburg without getting a shot off
the visitors are finding more space in attack with the likes of bertrand and yoshida able to draw the city full-backs into wider positions which opens up space in the middle
steven caulker has finished his very brief warm-ups and is finally set to come on for southampton who are back to full strength
fantastic running from de bruyne who beats a speedy bertand along the right showing incredible pace as city look to exploit southampton who are playing short one centre-back at the moment
all attention was on long following the challenge which did n't even result in a free kick but it 's jose fonte who is the real fitness worry
otamendi has really escaped with one here as he goes hard into long getting a stray knee into the back of the striker who goes to ground in considerable discomfort
decent hit from ward-prowse from the ensuing free kick but it was always going to be difficult from that position for a right footer as there is n't enough bend behind it to squeak in at the near post
great play from mane who holds the ball up and then drives forward at kolarov
really confident bit of play from caballero who navigates his way through the mess of bodies to divert the free kick away from the head of van dijk before getting back into position to save a follow-up effort from amidst the chaos
bertrand has the beaing of sagna on the left and forces his counterpart into conceeding a free kick a few yards outside the area
he does so well to side-step a defender before driving a shot past caballero but is so unlucky as it rattles off the bar
it was a simple assist for de bruyne with delph making the most of a routine pass from the belgian
de bruyne squares for delph following a corner and the midfielder drives a shot in from range
mane is playing too narrow at the moment which has left yoshida on the short end of a two-against-one with every city attack
the wall does its job as kolarov 's powerful drive strikes a defender before deflecting safely behind for a corner though the danger is n't averted quite yet
romeu gives the ball away so cheaply with an errant pass in his own half allowing delph to break
stat raheem sterling has scored in three of his five barclays premier league games against southampton
sterling made that all possible with his delightful run along the left serving the ball up on a platter for the belgian
sterling makes a darting run along the left channel and into the penalty area before squaring for de bruyne who taps a finish into an empty net
stekelenbug covers a lot of ground in scrambling over to the near post to keep out kolarov 's effort which was destined for the top corner
they have a slight concern as aguero is hacked to the ground by wanyama after an encouraging run but he appears fine to continue
great linkup play on the left between sterling and toure to play the ivorian through
ander herrera replaces juan mata who did n't have enough of a say in attack
fabregas threads a weak ball into the area and blind slips which allows it to go through for costa
costa fights off both rooney and blind to get on the end of willian 's free-kick but he ca n't direct it on target
united make their second change of the evening and there is a loud roar from the away supporters as goalscorer jesse lingard is withdrawn
so poor from willian
smalling is booked for a deliberate handball which awards chelsea a glorious opportunity from a free-kick just a yard outside the left of the penalty area
a cynical tug of the shirt in midfield sees lingard into the referee 's book
van gaal draws from his bench to make his first change of the match and it sees morgan schneiderlin come on to provide some fresh legs in midfield with fellaini giving way
groans head throughout the ground as play is forced to be brought to a halt with carrick down seemingly suffering from a cramp
shades of the goal rooney scored in the manchester derby a few years back as a ball comes into the area from darmian and the striker meets it with a clever overhead kick
the spaniard this time denies his fellow countryman beating fabregas ' effort away at the near post
azpilicueta makes a determined run to keep a chelsea attack alive inside the united penalty area heading the ball back for ivanovic
chelsea make their final change of the match and they 're going for broke as pedro comes on to replace matic
willian floats a teasing delivery into the area but carrick is on hand to usher it behind for a corner
blind barges into the back of costa and gives an unnecessary push just outside the penalty area
important touch from rooney who gets the assist but that was all made possible by the cross from borthwick-jackson
what a special finish that is from jese lingard
gary cahill comes on to replace the french centre-half
who knows how long it could keep him out but based on the cringe-worthy nature of the landing and the pain he was in this is likely the last time we 'll see zouma on the pitch this season
this appears to be a terrible injury for zouma who lands very awkwardly hyper-extending his right knee before going down in real pain
hiddink has seen about enough and on comes belgian playmaker eden hazard
martial holds the ball up in the penalty are and tees up lingard atop the box but the winger 's strike is punched aside by a diving courtois
stat wayne rooney has scored five goals in his last five premier league appearances more than he had managed in his previous 25 apps in the competition ( 4 )
rooney is starting to come to life though
manchester united open the second half on the front foot and it nearly pays dividends as mata 's delightful ball over the top spots the run of rooney but it 's just a bit too tall for the striker who fails to make clean contact with his header
martial and willian have been the catalysts for either side who look at their best when the full-backs get forward and provide a bit of width
chelsea are refused a strong claim for a spot kick as blind blocks terry 's effort with his arm
a delightful delivery from a talented individual as darmian launches a diagonal ball into the box from out wide
lingard has been a real weak spot for united going forward
an excellent ball forward finds willian on the right fringe of the penalty area
oscar gets on the end of the latest bit of interplay inside the area but from in close he 's unable to find the top corner and kicks the advertising board in frustration
this one is met by the head of matic at the near post and he sends a glancing effort towards the far stick but de gea does well to get across and not just parry but make the save and hold on to prevent a rebound from falling to the lurking terry
fabregas ' delivery is met by costa but his header loops over the bar off blind
blind floats an excellent corner into the area which actually lands at the feet of fellaini
martial continues to give ivanovic trouble on the flank
in a near replica of his goal midweek martial starts at the top corner of the area cuts onto his right and tries to pick out the far corner
willian makes a darting run through the heart of midfield to advance the ball into the final third which gets the home fans going
borthwick-jackson has been lively thus far and is providing the best attacking threat with his crossing from the left
fabregas has dropped deeper in an attempt to provide a serviceable link between defence and attack
they will be buoyed by their performance midweek and the intent from the red devils is already clear with borthwick-jackson and darmian prominent on the overlap
the delivery is again a poor one and city can again forge a counter-atatck with fernandinho and zabaleta combining down the right wing to win a corner
a free-kick now for city that silva drifts in to iheanacho whose flicked-header is cleared by mbokani but only as far as zabaleta who drinks a cross back in
a final change now then for city as bacary sagna is replaced by the more attack-minded pablo zabaleta for the remaining five minutes plus stoppage time
kompany and sagna make a mess of a clearance and the ball bounces back into the path of mbokani
sloppy from sterling as he - for a reason known only to himself - stalls his run after iheanacho had played a neat ball into his path
good work from mbokani as he shows his experience by winning a free-kick off kompany down on the left flank
a second change now for city as kelechi iheanacho - who made his first start in the reverse fixture - replaces jesus navas
more good defending from norwich as klose gets across to prevent aguero latching onto a cross at the near post
another booking now for norwich as jonny howson picks up a yellow card for a cyncial foul on fernandinho who had got the better of the former leeds midfielder with a neat bit of footwork
both jerome and mbokani are natural front-men though since the introduction of sterling neil ’ s side have found themselves been pushed back deeper and deeper
and that change is actually a double one as norwich ’ s third and final substitution sees patrick bamford make way for cameron jerome
a second game of the change now for the hosts and it is certainly an attacking one from neil as he replaces wes hoolahan with dieumerci mbokani
silva drives a low effort on target from the resulting set-piece which clatters off the wall and pin-balls around in the norwich area before dorrans reacts to hook it clear deep into city ’ s territory
superb from aguero
sterling ’ s first involvement in the game is to drive past o ’ neil down the left and win a free-kick after being brought down by the former middlesbrough and portsmouth midfielder
poor from navas as he twice fails to get a decent cross into the area from a corner down on the right
a change now for city as their second-highest scorer raheem sterling enters the fray to add some more width and pace to the visitor ’ s so-far lacklustre attack
solid defending again from klose as the former wolfsburg defender powers out to prevent bony getting on the end of fernandinho ’ s cross
it ’ s certainly an open and flowing game at carrow road though jon moss does have a decision to make after otamendi - already on a booking - clatters clumsily into dorrans
more pressure from city but again they are unable to carve out any space in between norwich ’ s stubborn defence and the home side are able to counter through hoolahan
navas dinks in the free-kick but in all truth it was a poor one and norwich clear it - though only as far as aguero
a corner now at the other end after hoolahan ’ s cross is deflected wide
city have started the second half in a similar fashion to how they began the first - well in control with silva dictating the tempo of their attacks
despite city controlling over 70 % of possession in the early stages they could not muster a clear chance until just prior to the half-hour mark when aguero raced clear of olsson and powered a low strike at goal that ruddy reacted instinctively to parry wide
the visitors dominated proceedings in the opening half-an-hour but since then the hosts have had the better of the game with bamford going agonisingly close to giving them the lead with what would arguably have been a goal of the season contender on his first premier league start
great play again from the hosts as dorrans drives in from the right wing and attempts to curl an effort into the top-left corner but it takes a slight deflection and sails out for a corner
and that injury duly results in a substitution for the hosts as graham dorrans who himself has been out with an injury lately comes on to replace his stricken teammate
a real dilemma for norwich now as redmond again goes down onto the turf with what looks to be a re-occurance of that ankle injury he picked up earlier
a brief rest-bite now for city as silva clichy and fernandinho make some headway down the left wing and retain possession down by the corner flag
the strike dips and swerves and evades hart but rather than nestling into the back of the net clatters off the woodwork
again city have kompany to thank as their skipper twice makes superb blocks to prevent redmond and then jarvis getting their crosses into the box
more patient play from the hosts as they again look to make headway down the left flank through olsson who drives in an inviting low cross but once more city ’ s captain kompany reads the situation perfectly and gets across to make the block
redmond has made his way back into the fray now and looks to be moving relatively freely as norwich forge another well-worked move into city ’ s final third but bamford is just unable to latch onto o ’ neil ’ s cross
a pause in play now as redmond receives treatment for an apparent knock to his ankle
that ’ s a super stop from ruddy who gets down low to his right to get a big strong hand to aguero ’ s driven effort that was destined for the bottom-left corner of norwich ’ s net
redmond drives in the free-kick to a dangerous area but hart comes out to command his area and gather it in before getting city ’ s counter-attack kick-started at pace
bamford drops deep into midfield and sets martin off with a superb first-time pass
howson and hoolahan combine to set up olsson for the cross down the left and the former blackburn rovers full-back duly delivers a flat ball in but kompany is well-placed to cut out the danger ahead of bamford who was lingering on the shoulder of the belgian
fernandinho is the architect in this instance as he drifts a precise 40-yards pass to clichy who despite finding himself free in acres of space in the hosts ’ penalty area can only fire a tame cross into the side-netting
navas and silva link up down the right before the latter tees up aguero who twists and turns towards goal before drilling a low effort in from the edge of the area but it trickles harmlessly wide of the upright
aguero tries his luck from the free-kick with a dipping strike that gets up and over the wall but ruddy is equal to it to prevent the effort nestling in the top-right corner
silva really is running the show at the minute for city as he drops deep to pick up possession and spread a lofted throughball towards aguero
a retrospective yellow card then for ryan bennett who really did dive in late on silva in the build-up to that chance and can have no complaints
bennet dives in heavily on silva who stays down injured after managing to prod the ball onto bony
silva picks out the run of aguero with a sublime pass but the argentine - who has scored 10 goals in his last 10 appearances - had made his move just too early and is correctly flagged for offside
good play from norwich at the other end now as redmond picks up a pocket of space in the inside-right channel and slots a meat pass though to martin whose attempted cross is deflected wide for a corner
city are starting to get on the ball now with silva naturally dictating the tempo from that advanced central midfield position
an interesting tactical change for city as it appears that aguero is taking up a berth slightly out to the left at the moment with silva slotting in behind bony
anichebe is sloppy in the final third for west brom as his side look to assert some pressure near the end
another long-range effort here this time from bacuna but his effort is wild and met by ironic cheers from the home fans
yet his delivery is cleared by olsson
ayew comes up against mcauley as he carries the ball forward inside the albion penalty area yet he loses his footing and slips allowing the hosts to clear
a stinging effort from westwood is hit from distance forcing foster into a smart save down low to his left
gestede comes off for vertetout for villa shortly after coming on
it looks like that will be the end of the game for gestede now as he drops to the floor inside albion 's penalty area with what appears to be a hamstring injury
the visitors break down the left through ayew and charge forward with numbers
a decent ball from westwood is knocked long towards gestede who cushions the ball down into the path of bacuna but the villa midfielder can not quite race onto it as it instead rolls into the hands of foster
gil is caught late by mcclean near his own corner flag as the hosts defend
positive changes for west brom in this second half it has to be said with pulis throwing on berahino anichebe and mcmanaman in the final third
a final roll of the dice for albion as mcmanaman comes on for sessegnon
cissokho this time attempts an early cross towards the head of gestede but the former blackburn man has little space to work in under a sheet of albion defenders forcing him to knock his header wide
villa launch a counter attack through bacuna who commits dawson into a strong challenge inside the penalty box forcing a corner
sessegnon must do better there after working the angle for a cross on the right but with bodies in the box drags a delivery to the edge of the area and into the path of claret and blue shirts
west brom are a little shaky at the back as a simple cross from westwood drops to olsson inside his own box
a first sight on goal here for gestede sees his header drop just wide of the goal
gil shows a nice pair of quick feet as he runs with the ball at the albion defence before playing the ball wide to westwood
a first change of the game for villa and a straight swap up front as gestede replaces kozak
rondon comes off for anichebe in one of two changes for pulis ' side
and here is berahino for albion as he takes the place of local boy gardner
a snap-shot from westwood is hit from distance but that does little to cause foster danger in the baggies goal
berahino is back out on the touchline warming up from the substitutes bench
a rare sight on goal here in this game falls to west brom after dawson 's cross from the right near the byline is knocked in towards rondon at the near post
we 're back underway after that short stoppage with the ball returned to bunn in the aston villa goal
he appears to have been caught a little late in a challenge with yacob although the collision looks fairly innocuous
a terrific cross from mcclean is whipped in towards the back-post but west brom do not gamble with bodies in the box allowing villa to clear at the second attempt
gardner steps up to take this free-kick and fires in a cross with real pace towards the near-post
a rough challenge from richards gives west brom the chance to cause danger early in this second half with a free-kick right on the edge of the penalty area
west brom get us underway for the second period at the second attempt after kozak closes down in the centre-circle a little too quickly thus ordering a re-take
they could be considered a little fortunate to not have conceded a penalty against ayew too for a mis-timed olsson challenge midway through the half
a second free-kick from gardner on the left is sent over the bar when he had far better options in the centre to aim for and that marks the end of the first half here at the hawthorns
a shaky moment from the villa goalkeeper comes from a free-kick as a delivery from gardner is dropped
kozak and richards are both up there to try and stab the ball towards goal but albion defend well to block and clear their lines
and richards does now pick up a booking for that challenge on yacob just minutes ago
a mis-placed pass from yacob allows gil to break down the right yet a cross is blocked
richards can count himself a little fortunate in the villa half as he flies into a challenge on yacob and misses the ball completely yet a yellow card is n't given by the officials - much to the frustration of the home crowd
a real chance for villa comes through kozak as he looks to have beaten the offside trap to latch onto a ball from gil inside the area
kozak does well to win the ball in the air after it is pumped long holding up play to slide it into the path on gil in support
